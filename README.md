# üß¨ Predicting Diabetes with a Random Forest

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes using diagnostic health data. By applying a Random Forest algorithm, we aim to build interpretable and accurate classification models. 

## üìö Overview

Utilizing a medical dataset from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases** our goal is to determine if a patient is lilkely to be diabetic.

## üìÅ Dataset

üìä Features:

- `Pregnancies`: Number of pregnancies
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness
- `Insulin`: 2-hour serum insulin
- `BMI`: Body mass index
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Genetic likelihood of diabetes
- `Age`: Age of the patient
- `Outcome`: Diabetes diagnosis (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `app.py` - The main Python script that you run for your project.
- `explore.py` - A notebook to explore data, play around, visualize, clean, etc. Ideally the notebook code should be migrated to the app.py when moving to production.
- `utils.py` - This file contains utility code for operations like database connections.
- `requirements.txt` - This file contains the list of necessary python packages.
- `models/` - This directory should contain your SQLAlchemy model classes.
- `data/` - This directory contains the following subdirectories:
  - `interin/` - For intermediate data that has been transformed.
  - `processed/` - For the final data to be used for modeling.
  - `raw/` - For raw data without any processing.
 
    
## Setup

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed on your. You will also need pip for installing the Python packages.

**Installation**

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Create a database (if needed)**

Create a new database within the Postgres engine by customizing and executing the following command: `$ createdb -h localhost -U <username> <db_name>`
Connect to the Postgres engine to use your database, manipulate tables and data: `$ psql -h localhost -U <username> <db_name>`
NOTE: Remember to check the ./.env file information to get the username and db_name.

Once you are inside PSQL you will be able to create tables, make queries, insert, update or delete data and much more!

**Environment Variables**

Create a .env file in the project root directory to store your environment variables, such as your database connection string:

```makefile
DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_url_here"
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the app.py script from the root of the project directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Adding Models

To add SQLAlchemy model classes, create new Python script files inside the models/ directory. These classes should be defined according to your database schema.

Example model definition (`models/example_model.py`):

```py
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class ExampleModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'example_table'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

```

## Working with Data

You can place your raw datasets in the data/raw directory, intermediate datasets in data/interim, and the processed datasets ready for analysis in data/processed.

To process data, you can modify the app.py script to include your data processing steps, utilizing pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
